>2.	Business Reputation: Timely deliveries enhances the company’s reputation for reliability and efficiency.
>3.	Revenue and profitability: Delayed projects can lead to revenue loss and unnecessary increased costs.
>4.	Team Morale. Timely deliveries boost team spirit, cohesion and motivation.
>
>Project managers can ensure deadlines are met through:
>1.	Realistic planning: Use proven techniques to estimate task durations realistically and allocate sufficient buffer time to account for unexpected challenges.
>2.	Effective Task Prioritization: Identify the most critical tasks and allocate resources accordingly. 
>3.	Continuous Project Tracking: Monitor progress and identify potential issues early using tools like Jira or Trello to also trace tasks and deadlines.
>4.	Strong Team Collaboration: Ensure everyone understands their role and expectations while encouraging open and honest communication within the team.
>5.	Continuous improvement: Analyze past projects to identify areas for improvement and use the lessons learned to refine future project management practices. 


2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?

> Effective cost control ensures that the project stays within budget, preventing financial risks and maintaining profitability. The following strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns.
>1.	Accurate Cost Estimation: Use past project data to estimate resource requirements and costs. Allocate a budget for unexpected issues.
>2.	Regular Budget Monitoring: Track all costs ranging from labor, hardware, software and third-party services to identify variances and take corrective action.

3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

>The waterfall model is rigid in nature meaning once the requirements are laid out, no changes can be made to them until the last phase is complete. While the agile model is flexible in nature meaning the requirements can be revised time to time and software development won’t be affected.
>The waterfall model is used in instances where the customer knows what they want and the requirements document won’t be subjected to rapid changes. While the agile model is used when the customer is not fully sure of what they want and they have rapidly changing requirements.
>The waterfall model is best for instances where the customer feedback is minimal and they are only interested in the final product. While the agile model is used best when customer feedback is more important to development and, when the customer wants to use the product during development through prototypes.
>
>Waterfall Methodology
>Advantages:
>1.	Clear Structure: Provides a well-defined structure and timeline.
>2.	Easy to Understand: Simple to manage and track progress.
>3.	Suitable for Well-Defined Projects: Ideal for projects with clear requirements and minimal uncertainty.
>Disadvantages:
>1.	Less Flexible: Difficult to accommodate changes or unexpected requirements.
>2.	Risk of Delays: Late identification of issues can lead to significant delays.
>3.	Limited Customer Involvement: Customer feedback is often limited to the beginning and end of the project.
>
>Agile Methodology
>Advantages:
>1.	Flexibility: Can adapt to changing requirements and market conditions.
>2.	Faster Time to Market: Delivers working software early and often.
>3.	Improved Quality: Continuous testing and feedback lead to higher-quality software.
>4.	Increased Customer Satisfaction: Involves customers throughout the development process.
>Disadvantages:
>1.	Requires Skilled Teams: Demands highly skilled and experienced teams.
>2.	Less Predictable: The final outcome may not be fully defined at the beginning.
>3.	Requires Strong Project Management: Effective management is crucial to ensure project success.

4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?

>Agile is best for complex projects with uncertain requirements or frequent changes while Waterfall is ideal for projects with clear requirements and a fixed scope.
>Agile is ideal for innovative projects which allow for exploring new technologies due to its iterative nature while Waterfall is best suited for regulatory-compliant projects that have strict regulations due to its structured nature.
>Agile is ideal for customer-centric projects due to its focus on customer feedback and collaboration while Waterfall is best for large-scale projects with many dependencies and little consumer feedback (e.g., government projects haha).

>Developing a new mobile app with evolving user needs and frequent tech advancements, agile is best. For building a large-scale enterprise system with strict compliance requirements, waterfall is recommended.


5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?

>1.	Testing: Check individual components and how they interact. Test the entire system as a whole against user requirements and invite end-users to interact with it in a real-world environment.
>2.	Code Reviews: Use tools to analyze code for potential errors, performance issues and security vulnerabilities. Have other developers review the code for quality, consistency and adherence to coding standards.
>3.	Continuous integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD): Deploy changes to production environments frequently and reliably alongside running automated tests with each code change to identify issues early.
>4.	Documentation. Maintain clear and up-to-date documentation for the system including user manuals, technical and API documentations.
>5.	Regular Code Refactoring: This is done to improve readability, maintainability and performance. 
>
>High quality standards are important for;
>1.	User Satisfaction: High-quality software provides positive UX leading to increased satisfaction and loyalty.
>2.	Reduced Cost: Detecting defects early can save significant costs in the long run.
>3.	Enhanced Security: Regular and rigorous testing can identify and address security vulnerabilities.
